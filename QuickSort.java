package sorting;
/**
 * 1. Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithms
 * 2. At each step find pivot and then make sure all the smaller elements are on the left
 *      of pivot & all bigger elements are on the right of pivot.
 * 3. It does this recursively until the entire array is sorted.
 * 4. Unlike the merge sortbit does not require any extra space.
 *    e.g; 9,4,6,3,7,1,2,11,5
 * NOTE:-Assume p is pivot element and j is first element(j=0) and i=-1 just before j.
 *       compare j <= p then swap i and j.
